GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides developers with tools for version control, collaboration, and project management by hosting Git repositories online. It allows teams to store, manage, and share code, enabling multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously by tracking changes, managing revisions, and facilitating discussions and code review through features like branches and pull requests.
